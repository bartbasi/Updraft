# Build notes: deviations from the plan, and open items

Kept by the lead builder. Anything that departs from `docs/opening-plan.md`, or that needs a
decision from the designer or the owner, is written down here rather than settled silently.

## Deviations from the opening plan

| Where | Plan | Built | Why | Needs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sunbeam angle | Sun about 40° from vertical; window x 85–93, y 15–24.5 | Sun about 18° from vertical (`SUNBEAM_SUN`); window x 83–93.5, y 14.7–24.9 | The lift follows the visible light exactly (code-review fix). At 40° the lift would hug the south wall, away from the centre line the player flies after the turn. The steeper light keeps lift and light on the line. Trade-off: the shaft reads as a high window/clerestory more than a low window. | Designer sign-off (Phase B) |
| Opening shot length | 0.9 s ease | 0.65 s ease (`intro_duration`) | The brief asks for the follow camera "within the first second" counted from the first frame; the plane also waits a few frames for smooth drawing. The designer's Phase A review approved it. | None |
| Door posts | Square jambs | Rounded posts, radius 0.6, drawn as they collide | A sharp corner turns a light clip into a head-on crash; rounded posts turn it into a bump. | None |
| Cones and lamp shades | (not in plan) | Collide exactly as drawn (convex hull) | They used to collide as full cylinders, an invisible wall (code-review blocker). This also changes the existing living-room lamp shade and the outdoor trees slightly. | None |
| Mobile in the bedroom | (dressing) | No collision | Soft paper birds on strings; the plane brushes through. | None |

## Designer's Phase A review (`docs/review-phase-a.md`): where each item went

| # | Item | Done in |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sloped header on the stair side of the arch, so non-divers glance through | Section 6 (arch) |
| 2 | `landing_turn` radius 2.0 → 3.0 | Section 8 (scoring) |
| 3 | `stair_downdraft` radius 2.0 → 1.5 | Section 8 (scoring) |
| 4 | Stronger wind swell in the dive | Phase B |
| 5 | Sunbeam path heights to match the real lift; test pilot uses the course's own paths | Section 8 (scoring) |
| 6 | Light shafts drawn 0.2 inside walls (no flicker) | Section 3 (sunbeam) |
| 7 | End card: "79 m = 791" and "N of 8 moments" | Section 8 (scoring) |

## Open items for Phase B

- A skilled run is about 52 s; the brief's goal is at least 60 s for a well-flown run. The
  designer's measured levers: gravity 8 → 7 (about +3 s), and a 15-unit longer gallery (about
  +3 s). See `docs/opening-plan.md` section 8.
- The lamp style moment (under the lamp) was not earned in any test-pilot run; show it can be flown.
- Late first-timers who scrape the taper sometimes weave across the gallery afterwards (a test
  pilot artifact, per code review); re-check with the full gallery.
- Camera and sound feel values move into `scripts/tuning.gd` (the brief's "one place" rule).
- Crash-to-flying time and frame rate need checking on a real phone ("Fly again" rebuilds the
  house in code).
